        <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Squats</p>

        <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Lunges</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
        <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Push-Ups</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
        <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Abdominal Crunches</p>
      </li>
      <li dir="ltr" aria-level="1">
        <p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Bent-over Row</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p dir="ltr">For walking you want to try and do it everyday, but don't push it. Only start with about 5-10 mins for the first time then when getting used to it slowly add more time as you go on like after a couple days go to 20 mins, then 30 mins, then finally an hour.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">For Interval training I'd say do it everyday but at a small amount when first staring, then slowly start doing more and more each day just like walking. you want to workout for 1-2 mins each time you do interval training then take a 2-10 minute break between each set.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">For Squats you wanna do it every other day since your thighs will be sore the day after doing the exercise, doing about 3 sets of 20 squats a day.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">For Lunges you want to do them&nbsp; every other day with the squats so you can have a day mainly for legs and you wanna probably do the same amount of Lunges as you do squats.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">For Push-Ups you want to do them every other day as well, but you wanna do them on the days that you aren't doing Squats and Lunges because its not the best for you to work more than one area of muscle in a day. you also probably want to do 3 sets of 15 Push-Ups.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">For Abdominal Crunches you want to also do them the same day you do Push-Ups because it works roughly the same area of the body as Push-Ups and you want to do the same amount of Abdominal Crunches, 3 sets of 15 Abdominal Crunches.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">For Bent-over Row you want to also do them the same days as the Abdominal Crunches and Push-Ups because again it will roughly work the same part of the body, being the upper body/ torso. However you will probably want to do less Bent-over Rows than you do Abdominal Crunches and Push-Ups. Doing 3 sets of 10 Bent-over Rows.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Ideal Diets</p>
    <p dir="ltr">The Ideal Diet for a Esports Player is a lean and high protein diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. While following this diet you want to try and avoid processed carbohydrates, simple carbs like candy, simple sugars, sodas, and even heavy carbs. making to where you aren't unhealthy and you want to strictly follow this or else your health wont be the greatest.    </p>
