    <p dir="ltr">Emergent's concept is to create a competitive hub through a Discord channel, counting on a leaderboard, rewards and in-house matchmaking. The Academy will focus on educational content, aiming to give the Game Changers community a chance to learn more about careers within the VALORANT ecosystem, according to a release. This will feature a range of competitions across different countries and regions, all of which will have an open qualifier stage in order to allow anybody to compete in the Contenders series. The article was quite easy to understand, they conveyed it well. They talked about how they wanna almost completely change how the game is played. The article really goes into depth. I am really interested about how they are trying to change the way the league in it's whole is played.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Day 2-</p>
    <p dir="ltr">North American E-sports organization OpTic Gaming and content creator trio TST have announced will host The Off-Season Charity Event, a weekend-long charity festival, on October 15th-16th. The event will take place at the E-sports Stadium Arlington in Texas. All the proceeds will be donated to Movember in support of charities focused on men&rsquo;s mental health and suicide prevention. It definitely conveys the message well and it is very easy to understand. The article goes into depth about the point of the charity. I found it interesting to see the team trying to help charity about mental health because it is always good to check up on men's mental health.&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Day 3-</p>
    <p dir="ltr">The three main reasons Johnson has provided for this are that EEG failed to provide 60-days notice, the allegations of &lsquo;cause&rsquo; were not justified; plus the allegations were false. To the latter reason, Johnson claimed that EEG&rsquo;s Board of Directors considered these same allegations back in April, 2022 and unanimously agreed that no investigation was necessary. In December, the company also announced a range of cost reductions that would be taking place after the company continued to make losses. EEG had an In December, the company also announced a range of cost reductions that would be taking place after the company continued to make losses. EEG had an adjusted EBITDA loss of $6.5m in fiscal Q4 2022. Even though the article is quite difficult to understand, it did convey the message it was going for. The article more than definitely goes into depth as to why it is doing this. What I found interesting is why they had sued the former entertainment groups CEO, because it shows the reason for them suing the CEO.&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Day 4-</p>
    <p dir="ltr">European E-sports organization ACEND Club has announced its departure from Halo E-sports, with its CEO Benjamin &lsquo;bencb&rsquo; Rolle posting a lengthy explanation of alleged poor league management and communication from game developer 343 Industries. In a statement on Twitter, Rolle commented that he did not feel that 343 and HCS understood how to create an attractive E-sports ecosystem for organizations &ldquo;especially outside of the North American region and partnership program&rdquo;. It kind of difficult to understand and it is ok at conveying the message. The article does stay relatively surface-level. I found it interesting that they have &quot;departed&quot; from Halo E-sports because they played halo for such a long time. &nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Day 5-</p>
    <p dir="ltr">North American esports and gaming organisation FaZe Clan has announced a multi-year partnership with luxury sports car brand Porsche. The partnership will see both parties work together on content creation, consumer products, web3 digital assets and goods, as well as esports integrations. obert Ader, CMO of Porsche AG, commented on the news that Porsche has been deeply involved in gaming and esports for several years, with a clear focus on racing staying true and authentic to the heritage and DNA of the brand. The message was conveyed well. The article goes pretty into depth about why they made this partner-ship. I find this article interesting, because I grew up watching FaZe clan and Porsche is one of my favorite car brands, I never thought I'd see them do a partnership.&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Day 6-</p>
    <p dir="ltr">The Miller Lite Player Lounge, located within Complexity&rsquo;s headquarters that it shares with the Dallas Cowboys, will remain sponsored by Miller Lite. Moreover, the company will introduce a video wall where Complexity teams can watch other esports teams compete. Miller Lite will be available in the Player Lounge for of-age players. It conveys its message very well. The article stays pretty surface-level. I found this article interesting because I'd never thought a esports team would be sponsored by a beer company.&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Day 7-</p>
    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">Content creator and streamer Ludwig Ahgren has become a co-owner of North American esports organization Moist Esports. As a result of the acquisition, Ahgren will have joint ownership of Moist Esports along with fellow streamer Charles White Jr, widely known as MoistCr1TiKaL. Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed by either party. It conveys the message decently well, its basically just talking about how Ludwig joined Moist Critical as Co-Owner. The article stays relatively surface level yet goes in depth at the same time. I found this article interesting because I wasn't expecting ludwig to just randomly become co-owner of Moist Critical.</p>

    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">Each month Esports Insider, in collaboration with Esports Charts, delves into esports viewership statistics to decipher what audiences are currently watching. Despite it being a new year, it seems that from a viewership standpoint, it&rsquo;s the same story as ever. Mobile esports is once again on top of the charts. However, with Asian goliaths Mobile Legends: Bang Bang and PUBG Mobile crowning world champions, that&rsquo;s hardly a surprise. Still, January saw League of Legends and CS:GO kickstart their competitive seasons, both of which are featured in the top five. The article was alright. It is genuinely easy to understand, it goes pretty into depth. I found this article interesting because it showed the charts of the viewership of different games and such and I knew the E-sports industry was big, but I didnt realize there were that many people that loved it.&nbsp;</p>

    <p dir="ltr">Day 10-</p>
    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">It basically just states how important communication is on a team and how it can easily help you win games. We didnt really add much, we just talked over strategies. On the list I did well with practice, as well as listening to my teammates. Some of the things I need to work on is being patient. our team as a whole did well, each of us responded to a call out the right way most of the time. Overall we did well over the whole list.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">Day 11-</p>
    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">Key highlights of the release include the departure of its CEO John Clarke and the company&rsquo;s plans to raise at least £1.5m in the following months to restructure the company and improve profitability. The company shared that it will close the Gfinity Arena in London, and that it has £400,000 in cash reserves available. Apart from Clarke&rsquo;s departure, Gfinity&rsquo;s current non-Executive Chairman Neville Upton will take on the role of Executive Chairman, and current Chief Financial and Operating Officer Jonathan Hall will work on the Esports Solutions business. I liked the article, it was pretty easy to understand yet difficult in some aspects. It went into depth a little bit,&nbsp; but relatively surface level. The article was interesting because I didn't expect the CEO to step down.&nbsp;</p>

    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">Teams can filter data to use in match analysis and talent evaluation when deciding on appointing new players to their respective rosters. The system is said to be fully automated, with private data being accessed through a secure API or application-based user interface. I liked the article. it conveys the message decently well, and it stays relatively surface level. Its interesting because i learned what a data portal is.&nbsp;</p>
