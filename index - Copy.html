    <p dir="ltr">The article just basically tells you all the good things videogames can do to you, how it gives you better social skills, that it&rsquo;s a great workout for the mind</p>

    <p dir="ltr">Why are video games and games in general so powerful a factor in society?</p>
    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">Videogames are so powerful factor in society because they bring people together. Even though they are apart they are brought together by the games</p>

    <p dir="ltr">I chose Smash Bros, cause it was one of the games i grew up playing. I played it on the Game Cube, on the WII and on the Nintendo Switch. It's fun to play cause it's a fighting game and fighting games are some of my favorites to play. It belongs to fighting games, but I would say that it also belongs to the strategy games category. The reason I say it's also a strategy game is because not only do you have to beat the other player(s) in a fight, you also have to know how to play the different characters, how your opponent plays, and you have to have a strategy on how to beat them. What makes it more unique is that it's a family friendly fighter and that it's almost strictly nintendo characters.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">I have chosen Valorant for my game to coach with, I have chosen to go with valorant because it is one of my favorite games and I think most people with pc's would have fun if they played it</p>

    <p dir="ltr">How does your social media use affect how you feel?</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Twitch, Tik Tok, Facebook, Instagram</p>
    <br />
    <p dir="ltr">If I'm being honest social media use makes me feel confused, because there is always so much going on and I cant keep up, especially with tik tok because people will always post the most random things that have happened and expect us to understand. They will literally post a small clip of what happened but not the whole thing and be like, &quot;I cant believe he did that!&quot;</p>

    <p dir="ltr">One thing the person I watched did well was he was really descriptive when he was describing how to do a certain type of move, I personally would place the wall differently. One thing I could do to be more descriptive is be more detailed whilst I'm doing the coaching.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">The best move to make in Valorant is most likely to take control of the site at soon as you can, when attacking you usually wanna try to take site almost immediately, but if your on defense and you lose site control after they plant you wanna try to rotate over then pick them off and get the proper set up for the site and it should make it significantly easier. It would definitely be inappropriate to do when you are alone in a like 1v3 situation.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">Um I haven't completely found website design but I feel it'll look good.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">10/5</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Gage Jacobs</p>
    <p dir="ltr">In my &quot;usual gaming area&quot; I sit down when I play. I have to different gaming locations, I have my pc where I play most of my games. Then there is my Xbox One X which I have connected to my TV and I'll sit either on a chair to play. I usually drink either a soda, tea or water when I am playing. Depending on the day and if I have anything to do I'll game for 3-4 hours, but if I don't have anything to do that day I could game all day usually.</p>
